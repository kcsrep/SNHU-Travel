How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories help incorporate the needs of the user by explaining how and why the features need to be implemented and how the user can interact with them. This allows me to prioritize the important aspects that the user needs in order to use the fatures.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I develop programs, I tend to organize and divide my program into small sections, this allows me to focus on tasks that needs to get done and manage them by importance and difficulty. I hope to incorporate sprint planning and sprint reviews in the future, to get a clear objective and be able to track my progress during the development of the program.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member to me means being open and receptive to criticism, and giving your peers the ability to voice their opinions without fear and being mindful of whether or not my code is easy to understand and has the necessary amount of comments.
